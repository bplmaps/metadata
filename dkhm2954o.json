		"fullNotes": "This dataset, which was acquired from data.census.gov, contains statistical information aggregated to the Census tract level and clipped to the extent of the city of Boston. It includes information about the estimated number of units in Boston per Census tract containing people paying rent, an estimate of occupied units with people paying a gross rent that is 30-34.5% of their total income, an estimate of occupied units with people paying a gross rent that is 30% or more of their total income and finally an estimate of people paying 35% or more of their total income. This data came from the American Community Survey rolling 5-year estimates, and covers a time period from 2014-2018.",		
		"briefGenealogy": "\n \n 1. Census tract geometries were downloaded from a census data extract tool. \n 2. Statistical data about rent as a percent of total income per census tract were also downloaded from a census data extract tool. \n 3. Extracted statistical tables were cleaned up to included only fields pertinent to the subject of inquiry. \n 4. Fields were renamed to human-readable column headers, and documented in a new codebook. \n 5. Cleaned up statistical tables were joined together in a GIS software with the census geometry files to create the new Boston Rent GIS dataset.",
