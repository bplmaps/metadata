		"shortDataDescription": "The datasets included as part of the Maptivist Data Collection were created for the purpose of using within the K-12 Maptivist Initiative at the Leventhal Map & Education Center. In Maptivist classrooms, students work with a variety of historical and modern map resources to better understand the past and present of Boston and advocate for change. Students connect with community resources, from individuals working for social justice to City of Boston data sets that enable them to analyze everything from gentrification in their neighborhoods, to health care access by race across the city, to climate resilienceâ€™s relationship to income inequality.",
