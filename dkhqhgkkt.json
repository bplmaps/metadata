		"fullDescription": " \n \n  - The American Community Survey (ACS) is a demographic data collection effort that is continuously being carried out by the U.S. Census Bureau \n  - Results of the survey are released every year by the U.S. Census Bureau \n  - Results are made available at different time scales: 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates \n  - Instead of sharing personal information about each individual who responds, the U.S. Census Bureau **aggregates** survey responses to broader geographic units, in order to protect individual's privacy \n  - You can download these statistical tables which are aggregated to different geographic scales, including: states, counties, zip codes, tracts and block groups  \n  - The ACS survey results are maintained in massive databases hosted by the U.S. Census Bureau and other authorized data providers \n  - To download the data, you will need to first decide which time period, geographic unit, and statistical theme you wish to work with \n  - Once you know these filters, you can use an extract tool to download the data you want, such as [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), or the more user and GIS-friendly [National Historic GIS (NHGIS)](https://www.nhgis.org/)",

It acknowledges Census Bureau reasoning for why the survey is mandatory. It explains why the data is beneficial to society. \n \n The documentation does not address how the Census Bureau understands participant consent. It is not clear if all participants understand how their data will be used. "
