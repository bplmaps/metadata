		"fullNotes": "This dataset, which was acquired from data.census.gov, contains statistical information aggregated to the Census tract level and clipped to the extent of the city of Boston. It includes information about the total number of households in Boston per Census tract, the total number of households without an internet subscription in Boston per Census tract, and a normalized field for the percent of households for each Census tract in Boston without internet. This data came from the American Community Survey rolling 5-year estimates, and covers a time period from 2014-2018. ",
		"briefGenealogy": "\n \n 1. Census tract geometries were downloaded from a census data extract tool. \n 2. Statistical data about rate of internet subscription per census tract were also downloaded from a census data extract tool. \n 3. Extracted statistical tables were cleaned up to included only fields pertinent to the subject of inquiry. \n 4. Fields were renamed to human-readable column headers, and documented in a new codebook. \n 5. Cleaned up statistical tables were joined together in a GIS software with the census geometry files to create the new Boston Internet Access GIS dataset. ",
