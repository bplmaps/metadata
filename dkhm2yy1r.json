		"fullNotes": "Statistical and geographic data comparing the 2006-2010 and 2014-2018 5-year American Community Survey summaries depicting change in median housing value for the city of Boston, Massachusetts. Created for the purpose of using within the K-12 Maptivist Initiative at the Leventhal Map & Education Center. In Maptivist classrooms, students work with a variety of historical and modern map resources to better understand the past and present of Boston and advocate for change. Students connect with community resources, from individuals working for social justice to City of Boston data sets that enable them to analyze everything from gentrification in their neighborhoods, to health care access by race across the city, to climate resilienceâ€™s relationship to income inequality.",

The documentation also touches on considerations related to how survey questions are worded, and the process by which new questions are added. Throughout the documentation, there are sections about how data is collected under various circumstances, for instance methodology for collecting information about those who live in group quarters, like nursing homes or prisons. The documentation includes a section on how stakeholders were initially consulted upon survey design, but it doesn't necessarily get into the process by which the Census Bureau continuously ensures and measures adequate representation in survey design and data collection.",

There is a Center for Economic Studies (CES) within the Research and Methodology division, which 'partners with stakeholders within and outside the Census Bureau to improve measures of the economy and people of the United States through research and the development of innovative data products.' The CES publishes updates about the projects and topics they are focused on. ",
