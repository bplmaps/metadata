		"fullNotes": "This data represents median home value change in Boston. The data originates from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey. The Census Bureau has aggregated individual survey responses to census tract geographies. The LMEC worked with cartographer Daniel Huffman to process the census data. We created a new dataset from the census data to study the change of housing value in Boston. The geography covers the City of Boston. The time coverage compares changes between 2006-2010 and 2014-2018, each as five-year averages. ",
		"briefGenealogy": "\n \n 1. We downloaded statistics about median home value from a census data download tool \n 2. We also downloaded census tract GIS boundary files from the same tool \n 3. We edited the data tables to only include important information about the topic of study \n 4. We renamed columns with human-readable column headers \n 5. We documented the new names in a codebook \n 6. We combined the new data tables to the GIS boundary files using GIS software to create the final dataset",
